# Resume Improvement

Ways to write better resume.

* KISS - Keep it short, simple
  * 1 Sheet, at most 2 page
* Not only what product done, also how they improve the company
  * `To blow agents mind you have to mention your personal ROI (return of investment) and "time to ROI" on your previous position. For example, if your salary was 5$k/m, you completed a project in 3 months and brought back to the company 60$k than your ROI is 45/15**100 = 300% and "time to ROI" is 3 months. It's essentially just one thing any company wants to know about you - how good you as an investment. Boom!`
* Contact should be visible, easy to find you
  * Maybe copy contacts to "header" and "footer" to increase its visibility
* Be professional
  * Hobbies, personal interests should not in resume
