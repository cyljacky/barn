# Not Useful

Stuff that found not really useful for me at the moment.

## Framework 

### [Laravel](https://laravel.com)

Full featured PHP framework with elegant syntax and good code design

- PHP is declining (in trend)
- steep learning curve

## Library

### [async](https://caolan.github.io/async/v3/)

Asynchronous Javascript with no dependencies

- async/await should fit current usage
