# Not Useful

Stuff that feels not useful at the moment.

## Application

### [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
[experience](../experience/jekyll.md)


Static site generator written in Ruby.
- Content migrated to Gitbook (this site)
- Using Hugo(Go) or Gastby(React) should be better choice for me

## Framework 

### [Laravel](https://laravel.com)
Full featured PHP framework with elegant syntax and good code design
- PHP is declining (in trend)
- steep learning curve

- PHP is declining (in trend)

## Library

### [async](https://caolan.github.io/async/v3/)
